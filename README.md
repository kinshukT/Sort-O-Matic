# Sort-O-Matic v2.0 Documentation

## Introduction
Sort-O-Matic v2.0 is an upgraded version of the web-based sorting algorithm visualization tool. It offers users an interactive platform to input, visualize, and analyze various sorting algorithms.

## Features
### Input and Visualization
1. Input Field: Allows users to input a series of numbers separated by spaces or commas.
2. Cell Visualization: Converts input numbers into visual cells on the screen for sorting visualization.
### Supported Sorting Algorithms
1. Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent elements and rearranges them if needed.
2. Selection Sort: Divides the input list into a sorted and unsorted region.
3. Merge Sort: Divides the array into smaller arrays and merges them back together.
4. Quick Sort: Uses pivot elements to partition and sort the array.
5. Heap Sort: Creates a heap and sorts it to achieve the desired order.
6. Radix Sort: Sorts integers by processing individual digits.
7. Shell Sort: A generalized version of insertion sort.
### Reset and Erase Buttons
1. Reset Button: Clears the cells, returning them to an unsorted state.
2. Erase Button: Clears the input field.
## Usage
1. Input Numbers: Enter a sequence of numbers in the input field.
2. Visualization: Click "Generate Cells" to visualize the input as cells on the screen.
3. Select Sorting Algorithm: Choose a sorting algorithm for visualization.
4. Reset and Erase: Use the buttons to reset cells or clear the input field.
## Implementation Details
### Technologies Used
1. Languages: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
### Sorting Sequence
2. Ascending or Descending: Users can select the sorting sequence.
## Future Enhancements
1. Interactive Controls: Introduce functionalities to pause, resume, or step through sorting animations.
2. User Data Handling: Implement the ability to save and load user input for future sessions.
3. Additional Sorting Algorithms: Incorporate more advanced or lesser-known algorithms for comparative analysis.
4. Enhanced Visualizations: Improve animations and visual cues to enhance user experience.


## Conclusion
Sort-O-Matic provides an interactive and educational platform to visualize how different sorting algorithms operate. It aims to assist users in understanding the fundamental principles behind sorting algorithms through visual representation.
